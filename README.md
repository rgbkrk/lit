Trying alternative approaches to a state tree for notebooks, including the way
reducers and state are set up. Core differences to nteract currently:

* `lodash/fp` instead of Immutable.js / commutable
* `flow` typing for more
* not actually a full implementation, just tinkering

## Development

Get yoself:

* node.js
* `yarn`
* a clone of this repo

```
yarn
yarn start
```
